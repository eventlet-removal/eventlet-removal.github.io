    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">Eventlet has been a popular choice for concurrent programming in Python, particularly within the OpenStack community. However, as <a href="https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/issues/972" class="text-cyan-400" target="_blank">the library has become deprecated</a>, it is crucial to explore alternatives that offer better support, performance, and future-proofing for your applications.</p>

    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">There is <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/risks.md %}"  class="text-cyan-400" target="_blank">plenty of reasons</a> to abandon your Eventlet usages. Keeping Eventlet means exposing your company to major legal risks, harming your team's productivity, compromising user security, and destroying your project's credibility. As Eventlet maintainers, we have witnessed these issues firsthand and believe it is our responsibility to help users move away from it. This guide is here to support you in a necessary and well-managed transition.</p>

    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">Migrating to libraries like AsyncIO or Threading can provide numerous benefits, including:</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Improved Performance</h2>
            <p class="mt-10 text-xl">Modern libraries often offer better performance and scalability for handling concurrent tasks. Modern libraries like Asyncio introduce new paradigms like real cooperative task handling. Threads, with modern versions of Python can benefits from <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/" class="text-cyan-400" target="_blank">PEP 703</a> to introduce real parallelism in your Python software.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Active Maintenance</h2>
            <p class="mt-10 text-xl">Actively maintained libraries receive regular updates, bug fixes, and new features, ensuring long-term viability. Active maintenance also mean more resources, tutorials, and peers to learn from and collaborate with.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Future-Proofing</h2>
            <p class="mt-10 text-xl">Adopting widely-used and supported libraries helps future-proof your applications against obsolescence. They provides guarantees of sustainability to your customers. AsyncIO and threading are both part of the Python standard library, making them a safe choice.</p>
