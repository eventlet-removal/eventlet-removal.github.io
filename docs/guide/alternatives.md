    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Understanding the Alternatives</h1>
    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">Eventlet is designed to facilitate asynchronous programming using green threads and monkey patching. Alternatives such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/fr/3.13/library/asyncio.html"  class="text-cyan-400" target="_blank">AsyncIO</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/fr/3.13/library/threading.html"  class="text-cyan-400" target="_blank">native threads</a> offer different approaches to concurrency and asynchrony, making them viable replacements for Eventlet.â€‹</p>

                <p>AsyncIO employs an explicit approach to asynchronous programming, utilizing <code class="text-xl language-python">async</code> and <code class="text-xl language-python">await</code> keywords. This explicitness enhances code readability and maintainability, allowing developers to clearly identify and manage asynchronous operations.â€‹</p>

    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">While Eventlet offers a means to achieve asynchronous programming through green threads and monkey patching, AsyncIO and native threads present robust alternatives. AsyncIO provides explicit and efficient asynchronous programming within Python's standard library, whereas native threads offer true parallelism and broad compatibility. The choice between these alternatives depends on the specific requirements of the project, such as the nature of the tasks (I/O-bound vs. CPU-bound) and the desired concurrency model.â€‹</p>
